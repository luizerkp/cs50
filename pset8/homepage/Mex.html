                <hr>
                <p>Mexico is a beautiful country with deep roots and a welcoming people. Home of the now extinct Mayan civilization known to have produced the world's most accurate
                calendar.  You can visit  one the new 7 wonders of the world <strong>Chichen-Itza</strong>, a Mayan ruin full of cultural significance and an impressive pyramid. When
                it comes to offerings Mexico really has it all whatever itches you adventurous bone, you can find it Mexico. Due in part to Hollywood/media and in part deserved; Mexico
                has a bad reputation for being a hot bed of violence due to drugs and the cartels; However the tourist areas are very safe and the cartels are isolated to certain
                cities. In other words, unless you go looking for trouble Mexico will be as safe as any other country you might visit so don't let those things stop you from visiting
                this wonderful country. Last but not leastâ€¦tacos!! that's right, that heavenly simplistic yet delicious food, this goes without saying but none does tacos better than
                Mexico. Tacos are awesome but Mexico has much more to offer when it come to good food and I think that while experiencing the deep history and vibrant culture of Mexico
                one should also experience it food.</p>

                <h3>Preparing to visit Mexico</h3>
                <p>If you want to visit Mexico you first need to find out whether you can get a visa on arrival or you need to apply for one in advance. To find out more visit the
                <a href= "https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/eua/index.php/en/2016-04-09-20-40-51/tourism/1600-planning-resources" target="_blank"> Mexican Embassy website </a>for the most
                up to date information on visa requirements and application process. I recommend ensuring your passport does not expire within 6 months and to apply for the visa, if
                needed, no less than 45 days before you depart. The process usually takes about two weeks but you want to have some wiggle room in the event of any mishaps. If are a
                US citizen, permanent resident or have a visa to the US, UK, Canada or Japan; you can get a visa on arrival and thus do not need to apply beforehand.</p>

                <h3>Planning the Trip:</h3>
                <P>The first thing you will want to do is to buy an airline ticket to the airport closest to your desired destination, as Mexico is a big country we will focus
                on the Quintana Roo state of Mexico which includes Cancun, Playa del Carmen, Tulum and Cozumel as main tourist destinations. I have found
                <a href="https://www.skyscanner.com/" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a> to be very useful in getting the best deals on airfare, otherwise you can try the other big names like
                <a href="https://www.expedia.com/" target="_blank">Expedia</a> or <a href="https://www.priceline.com/?vrid=f8e7a0a23eafb4bae1821e9f0bd49f1b" target="_blank">Priceline</a>. If it is your first time
                going to Mexico I highly recommend one of the aforementioned areas as your first destination. Whether you choose to stay in one area or hop around a bit, do not just
                spend your whole vacation cooped up in your hotel or resort. It will be tempting to  just "chillax" by the pool sipping margaritas with maybe a water park or ziplining
                day thrown in the mix but you will miss out on some unique experiences like <a href="https://www.islandlifemexico.com/best-cenotes-in-yucatan/" target="_blank">Cenotes </a> which are
                large sinkholes or caves that are half submerged, think spelunking but in the water, or visiting one of the new 7 wonders of the world <strong> Chichen Itza</strong> or
                the beautiful and colorful city of Valladolid. If you are not claustrophobic you can try a Cenote tour, there are plenty of cenotes to choose from  in the area and the
                hotel/ resort will likely have tour or a brochure to one, However I have found that the best ones are near or around the City of Tulum; if staying near or in Cancun
                the trip might be around 2.5 hrs but well worth it the day trip so plan accordingly. You can always just relax by the pool/beach/ or go ziplining/amusement park depending
                on your enrgy level. For amusement parks/ziplining we have Xel-Ha, Xplor, Ventura Park, Selvatica ect. Do note, that if staying at
                <a href="https://www.xcaret.com/en/hoteles-xcaret/" target="_blank">Xcaret resort </a>depending on your reservation; you will have access to all their amusement parks and tours which
                also includes a cenote tour and a <strong>Chichen Itza</strong> tour. Cozumel is also a choice if you want do is relax, zip on a beverage of choice and admire beautiful white
                sand beaches or view some beautiful undeveloped and undisturbed naturescapes. Mexico has plenty of options not matter how adventurous you are, it has delicious food and wondaful
                people so don't be afraid give Mexico a try you won't be disappointed.</p>
