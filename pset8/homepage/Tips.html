                            <div id ="answer1" class ="answers">
                            <p> The answer to this might seem self evident, "why spend money on a ticket without even
                            even knowing if you'll be allowed to enter your destination country?" However the answer is little more
                            tricky than that; you definitely want to go over the visa requirements before you even start
                            planning your trip. If you find that you meet all the requirements you will need to buy a ticket
                            first as part your application process, note that this is ONLY  true if, you do not get a visa on
                            arrival. I encourage you to go over to the embassy website of you destination get all the information
                            before you make any plans.</p>

                            <p>Depends; if traveling domestically, already have a visa or can get a visa on arrival then as soon as you
                            you spot a good deal. If traveling internationally however, this will heavily depend on
                            your visa status and or visa applications requirements. On the other hand you can buy a more expensive
                            refundable ticket. These tickets allow you to get a refund if need to cancel your flight however make sure to read your particular airline's
                            refund policy before buying. A good rule of thumb I follow is 2-3 months from my intended date of travel.</p>

                            <p>Short answer: less than you think. You should look at how many days you will be traveling and avoid
                            bringing extra clothing or items for "just in case". Remember airlines charge a premium for extra weight/baggage, so pack what you need
                            and only what you need. Also traveling with too much baggage can be a hassle and tiring.</p>

                            target="_blank"> cheapair.com, </a>the best day of the week to buy your ticket is Tuesday. The most expensive month to fly is March and the best time frame to
                            buy your ticket, for the the cheapest fares, is 21 to 95 days before your travel date. Also I have personally experienced that if you fly
                            between Friday-Monday your ticket will generally be more expensive. You may want to consider flying out on a Tuesday or Wednesday if you can.</p>

                            <div id="answer5" class ="answers">
                            <p> While Thailand is not as harsh and draconian as let say N. Korea, there are somethings that are taboo in the country. <br>
                                Here are the top 5:</p>
                            <ol class= "list">
                                <li>Disrespecting the royal family in any way shape or form: While in Thailand you should keep all your comments about the royal family respectful. This is true out
                                in the streets and online like social media.</li>
                                <li>Climbing or touching Buddha statues, wearing or using the image of Buddha as decoration on clothing especially if that clothing will touch the floor in anyway...
                                also tattoos depicting the image of Buddha are a big no no. Just be respectful of Buddha and you will be fine.</li>
                                <li>Monks take an oath to touch women so if you are woman do not touch monks, even something as simple passing an offering or item to a Monk is not allowed. Also monks are
                                highly respected in Thailand so treat them respectfully and respect their boundaries.</li>
                                <li>Excessive PDAs(public displays of affection), while this won't get you in trouble per say it will get you odd looks. A quick peck in the cheek is not a problem but
                                full on making out in public is frowned upon.</li>
                                <li>Touching the head of someone older than you or passing something over their head is considered extremely rude.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <button class ="question" value="answer6"><strong>Do I need to purchase travel insurance?</strong></button>
                            <div id="answer6" class ="answers">
                                <p>When it comes to travel insurance, the decision is up to you; just like car insurance you buy it but hope to never have to use it. If
                                you want a piece of mind you may purchase a travel insurance plane. They can cover everything from just you ticket to hospitalization or
                                death. The plans are usually inexpensive can range from few 10USD to few 100USD. It depends on length of stay, age, pre-existing conditions, coverage ect.
                                The decision is really up to you but if you are traveling within your home country then you don't need it. Traveling internationally it is highly
                                recommended but not required especially if the credit card you used offers it and you have health insurance. Most health insurance plans cover you
                                while you travel.</p>

                            <div id="answer7" class ="answers">
                                <p>My rule of thumb is enough to cover incidentals plus some emergency cash (usually around 250USD-500USD). Ideally you want to carry as little cash on your as you
                                can and make all purchase using credit. Avoid showing a lot of cash in public. Try to have a good credit card that won't gouge you on the exchange rate. Also try
                                to pre-book all your excursions before you travel or online. If you don't have a good credit card then the goal is to to bring at least 50USD per person per day. You
                                make use the hotel safe and only carry what you need fo that day. I you don't feel comfortable leaving stuff in the hotel safe then buy anti-theft bag and separate
                                cash between different locations on your body only keeping a small amount in your pocket.</p>

                            <div id="answer8" class ="answers">
                                <p>Avoid exchanging money at the airport you will never get the best rates that way. Also try to bring large denominations with you as those give out better rates.
                                Avoid exchanging all you cash at once and only exchange as you need. Avoid exchanging or withdrawing money in secluded areas. Local exchange places can usually be
                                reliably found in malls, movie theaters and in some hotels.</p>

                            <div id="answer9" class ="answers">
                                <p>The answer is simple by using a credit card with good travel redemption like Chase Sapphire or Amex Platinum and using the points or miles. Sometimes just
                                the introductory points is enough to buy a ticket. Using those credit cards to pay for all you daily needs and bills and paying off the statement balance on the
                                due date is a easy and free way to get free tickets and other benefits like free airport lounge access. If you have a decent credit score and are not using a
                                travel credit cards to make most if not all your purchase then you are leaving hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on the table every year. Just remember
                                that credit is not supplemental expending power but a cash replacement. If you can't afford it with cash then try not to buy it if you can afford not to.</p>

                                <p>Short Answer: Anywhere; Long Answer: with the advent of youtube and the internet you can virtually travel to any country in the world. If you want to
                                travel but are not sure where a quick google search or youtube search and you can start checking out all those beautiful and exciting places in the world. I
                                personally recommend somewhere close like Mexico or a Caribbean Island if living the USA. Another easy place is Puerto Rico, The Virgin Islands and other US territories,
                                while these are part of the USA, it still gives you the feeling of traveling abroad.</p>
